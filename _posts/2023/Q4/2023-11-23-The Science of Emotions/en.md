### 1. The Minds of Animals

→ Can neuroscience help us study the emotions of animals?

Research has revealed that various animals, such as chickens, dogs, and cats, also experience emotions. Interestingly, these **primitive emotions** are found to originate not in the *cerebral cortex*, where human thinking and planning occur, but in much older brain structures.

### 3. The Brain’s Opioids

→ The activation of PANIC emotions may be central to the psychological pain that leads to depression. Studies on birds and chimpanzees have shown that our brains release opioid-like substances when in contact with a mother.

### 4. New Concepts

→ These findings suggest that prescribing safer opioid-based medications (with lower addiction potential and stronger effects) could improve conditions for depression patients, potentially preventing suicide.

→ Similarly, experiments related to SEEKING and PLAY could enhance human passion and foster positive interpersonal relationships.
