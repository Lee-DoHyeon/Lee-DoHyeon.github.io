> Siddhartha, by Hermann Hesse: **A Journey of Wandering and Crisis, Focused on Hesse's Life**

### Key Sections

📝 … Whether this world is good or evil, whether life in this world is painful or joyful, I will no longer discuss. Perhaps these are not the essential questions. But the unity of this world, the interconnectedness of all events, the way everything, great and small, follows the same flow and law of creation and destruction—this is made clear by your noble teachings. … However, according to these same teachings, there is a break in this unity and continuity. Through a small gap, something foreign, something new, something that has not existed before and cannot be presented or proven, enters this unified world. … (Conversation with Buddha; Siddhartha's Counterargument)

📝 Only one who has delved deep into their own inner being can look with such sincerity and walk such a path. Very well, I will explore to the ultimate depths of my own being … I will no longer lower my eyes before any other person. … This man's teachings could not tempt me, and no teaching will tempt me ever again. (Siddhartha's Enlightenment)

> Siddhartha, reflecting on the origins of Gautama Buddha's enlightenment, realizes that the origin lies in Buddha's own experiences—his first-person experience. Buddha’s teachings, therefore, are based on something that cannot be presented or proven. Consequently, Siddhartha realizes that Buddha's enlightenment cannot be transferred to him in its entirety, leading him to challenge Buddha. Ultimately, Siddhartha embraces the importance of personal experience and begins his journey of self-discovery.

📝 … As Siddhartha walked slowly, he pondered the feelings that filled him entirely. Like sinking into deep water, he descended to the very bottom of these emotions, where the cause resided. He believed that recognizing the cause was the essence of thought. Only then could emotions transform into understanding, not by disappearing, but by becoming something fundamental, something that begins to radiate its inner truth.

📝 If someone reads a text and seeks its meaning, they do not disregard the symbols and letters. They do not dismiss them as illusions, coincidences, or worthless shells. Instead, they read, savor, and cherish each letter. But I, in trying to read the book of this world and the book of my own essence, disregarded the symbols and letters in order to match a preconceived notion of meaning. I called the phenomenal world an illusion, and I dismissed my eyes and tongue as meaningless, accidental phenomena. But no, that is over. I have awakened. Truly awakened, and today, I have been born anew. …

> These passages express Siddhartha's deep understanding of emotions and self, revealing his insights into the essence of feelings and the realization of phenomena. He delves into the core of emotions, recognizing that understanding them causes them to radiate their true nature. Furthermore, in terms of self-concept, he discovers that even if experiences are mere illusions or coincidences, they are still worth savoring and cherishing.

↔ How does this relate to Anil Seth's concept of consciousness as "controlled hallucination"?

Even if it is so, to find its meaning, it must be fully savored and loved.

> Life contains no inherent happiness, sorrow, success, or failure. These concepts require standards and evaluation. They exist solely within the experience of living "I." No third party can truly empathize with or evaluate my life. Common standards or public opinions are nothing but illusions, mere misconceptions.

> Let us clearly distinguish between the aspects of life we can control and those we cannot. While this is the most challenging task, focusing solely on the controllable aspects will clarify how to navigate life. The beginning and momentum of my life lie in faith, and it is this faith that determines the direction and trajectory of the arrow that is my life.
