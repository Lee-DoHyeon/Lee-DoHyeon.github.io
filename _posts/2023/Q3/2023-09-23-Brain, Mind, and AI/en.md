## Chapter 2. What is the Brain?

(This chapter explains the neurophysiological structure and detailed functions of the brain.)

→ The brain is a massive network composed of 100 billion neurons, weighing about 1.4kg and having a volume of approximately 1400cc.

1. Brainstem

   > It is the basic life-support device, acting as the center of autonomic functions like breathing.
   > It controls sleep and wakefulness and serves as the pathway for information going from the outside to the cerebrum and from the cerebrum to the outside.

2. Cerebellum

   > Although it weighs only about 10% of the brain, it contains the most neurons, around 80 billion.
   > It is responsible for perception and motor control, working in coordination with the cerebrum.
   > Motor functions acquired over time in the cerebrum are transferred to the cerebellum and become routine, allowing for rapid processing.

3. Cerebrum

   > The part that develops the slowest.
   > Composed of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and amygdala, it contains about 20 billion neurons.
   > It is responsible for functions such as cognition, thought, language, motor planning and control, and memory, facilitating higher mental functions.

   The surface area is about 2000-2500cm^2 (roughly the size of a newspaper page), and it consists of a sheet 2-3mm thick.
   It is made up of six layers forming columnar structures.

## Chapter 5. Interpreting the Brain with Mathematics (2)

> How does actual brain learning occur?
> Investigating the neural circuits of the brain reveals that there is no phenomenon like error backpropagation, where errors flow backward through the circuit for learning.
> Therefore, perceptron learning cannot be seen as modeling the structure of the brain.

However, it cannot be concluded that they are completely different either. Stochastic gradient descent is an algorithm that expresses one principle of learning information processing. The brain may not have realized this principle in its actual structure.

## Chapter 6. History and Future of Artificial Intelligence

> IBM also began seriously participating in neuro-computation. In the United States, the Department of Defense's DARPA led a program called "SyNAPSE," aiming to create neural circuits on chips. In response, IBM succeeded in developing a neurochip named "TrueNorth."
> This chip contains 1 million neurons and 256 million synaptic connections, consuming only 70mW of power. A system combining these chips boasts 48 million neurons and 12 billion synapses, comparable to a mouse brain.
