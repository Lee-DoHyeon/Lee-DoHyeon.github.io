# Toward Unified Science of Mind-Brain-Behavior

The information revolution and the cybernetics movement of the mid-20th century significantly influenced not only physics but also the academic approach to the human mind and spirit, the brain and body, and the behavior of human and animal societies. As the relationship between information and mathematical forms began to gain attention during this period, information theory and statistical mechanics underwent significant changes. These movements aimed to formalize the academic study of human nature and life, but due to technological limitations and philosophical issues at the time, they are **proliferated** into numerous fields in the latter half of the 20th century, including psychology, psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience, economics, anthropology, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

Looking at the history of physics, the development of **principles**, **mechanics**, and **dynamics** that correspond to the questions of 'why,' 'how,' and 'what' is necessary to create robust theories capable of explaining, controlling, and predicting new phenomena. Currently, there exists a confusion of various dynamics, mechanics, and principles that partially explain the mind-brain/body-behavior relationships.

In this context, a **normative theoretical approach** that seeks to integrate and reduce various academic frameworks has significantly developed. Notable examples include Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle and Active Inference, and Samuel Gershman's Inductive Bias / Approximation Principle. These theories focus on explaining biological systems and psychological and behavioral phenomena. However, there still exist complex phenomena such as consciousness, feelings, and hypnosis that modern science fails to explain. These phenomena involve biological complexity and evolutionary characteristics, which may not be sufficiently explained by simple physical or information-theoretic approaches. Therefore, an integrated and multidimensional approach across various academic fields is needed to understand them.

While these approaches focus on finding the 'why,' modern artificial intelligence research emphasizes the 'how,' i.e., **engineering applications**. Concepts like Jurgen Schmidhuber's Self-supervised Learning and World Model, Geoffrey Hinton's Boltzmann Machine, and David Rumelhart's Helmholtz Machine have presented crucial ideas for developing AI that resembles human intelligence. Given that information theory is not a mere subset of physics but holds a unique status, it might necessitate the introduction of irreducible additional principles and the formation of a set of diverse principles.

The language of modern artificial intelligence fundamentally uses various mathematical forms grounded in **information theory**, such as information geometry and Optimal Transport. Just as E. T. Jaynes reinterpreted statistical mechanics from the perspective of information theory, suggesting an integrative relationship between the two fields, exploring the intersection of information theory and physics can yield new insights. This integrative approach shows how information-theoretic principles and physical laws complement each other to explain mind-brain-behavior systems.

In conclusion, understanding the mind-brain-behavior system requires an integrative approach **combining information theory and physical principles**. Information-theoretic principles explain how physical systems process information, predict, and regulate behavior, while physical laws provide a fundamental understanding of how these systems actually operate. Exploring the intersection of information theory and physics can contribute to new research and discoveries. This essay provides critical insights for building an integrated scientific system to understand the mind-brain-behavior system better, thereby laying the foundation for comprehending the functioning of complex biological systems.

### Summary

> The information revolution and the cybernetics movement of the mid-20th century significantly influenced the study of the human mind and behavior, promoting the development of information theory and statistical mechanics, and leading to diversification into various academic fields. The development of principles, mechanics, and dynamics to address the 'why,' 'how,' and 'what' questions in physics is necessary. Normative theoretical approaches integrating multiple disciplines have developed, exemplified by Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle and Samuel Gershman's Inductive Bias Principle. However, complex phenomena like consciousness and feelings require a multidimensional approach beyond simple physical theories. Modern AI research focuses on the 'how,' with significant contributions from researchers like Jurgen Schmidhuber and Geoffrey Hinton. Information theory provides new insights at the intersection with physics, crucial for understanding mind-brain-behavior systems. Integrating information theory and physical principles helps to comprehend complex biological systems better.
