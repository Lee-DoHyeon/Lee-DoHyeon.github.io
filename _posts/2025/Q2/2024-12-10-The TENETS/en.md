Below are the philosophies, principles, and hypotheses I find essential when researching human-level AI and translating cybernetics and cognitive science into machine learning.

<aside>
üí° **PHILOSOPHY**

1. **‚ÄúWhat I cannot create, I do not understand‚Äù (Feynman)**  
   Richard Feynman said that to truly understand a phenomenon, one must be able to reconstruct its mechanism from the ground up.

2. **‚ÄúWhat is it like to be a bat?‚Äù (Nagel, Uexk√ºll)**  
   Thomas Nagel argued that non-human qualitative experiences‚Äîsuch as a bat‚Äôs echolocation‚Äîcan never be fully captured by a human third-person objective description. Together with Jakob von Uexk√ºll‚Äôs concept of the _Umwelt_, he maintained that each species‚Äô unique perceptual world never completely overlaps with another‚Äôs, and therefore humans can never truly empathize with non-human consciousness.

**> HYPOTHESES / PRINCIPLES**

1. **Bayesian Brain Hypothesis (Helmholtz, Hinton, Doya)**  
   Building on Helmholtz‚Äôs notion of unconscious inference, Hinton and Doya proposed that the brain treats sensory inputs as probabilistic models and updates them according to Bayesian rules.

2. **Free Energy Principle (Friston, Parr, Pezzulo)**  
   Karl Friston suggested that living systems minimize variational free energy to reduce prediction error and maintain stability. Parr and Pezzulo later extended this framework into the theory of active inference.

3. **Emergence, Holism, and Gestalt Principles (Koffka, Bertalanffy, Anderson)**  
   Kurt Koffka‚Äôs ‚Äúthe whole is more than the sum of its parts,‚Äù Ludwig von Bertalanffy‚Äôs systems holism, and Philip W. Anderson‚Äôs ‚ÄúMore Is Different‚Äù all emphasize that novel properties emerge in complex systems that cannot be reduced to their individual components.

4. **Computational Irreducibility (Turing, Wolfram, Chaitin)**  
   Alan Turing‚Äôs halting problem, Gregory Chaitin‚Äôs algorithmic randomness, and Stephen Wolfram‚Äôs cellular automata research demonstrate that certain processes cannot be predicted without simulating every step of their computation.

5. **Law of Requisite Variety (Ashby, Boisot & McKelvey)**  
   To regulate the complexity of an external environment, a system must have internal variety that is equal to or greater than that of the environment. Moreover, organizations should not only match external variety quantitatively but also design the quality and structure of their internal complexity to suit environmental demands.
