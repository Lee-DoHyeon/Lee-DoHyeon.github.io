Below are the philosophies, principles, and hypotheses I find essential when researching human-level AI and translating cybernetics and cognitive science into machine learning.

## Philosophy

1. **“What I cannot create, I do not understand” (Feynman)**  
   To truly understand a phenomenon, one must be able to reconstruct its mechanism from the ground up.

2. **“What is it like to be a bat?” (Nagel, Uexküll)**  
   Non-human qualitative experiences—such as a bat’s echolocation—can never be fully captured by a human third-person objective description. Jakob von Uexküll’s concept of the _Umwelt_ highlights that each species’ unique perceptual world never completely overlaps with another’s.

## Hypotheses / Principles

1. **Bayesian Brain Hypothesis (Helmholtz, Hinton, Doya)**  
   The brain treats sensory inputs as probabilistic models and updates them according to Bayesian rules, building on Helmholtz’s notion of unconscious inference.

2. **Free Energy Principle (Friston, Parr, Pezzulo)**  
   Living systems minimize variational free energy to reduce prediction error and maintain stability. Parr and Pezzulo extended this into the theory of active inference.

3. **Emergence, Holism, and Gestalt Principles (Koffka, Bertalanffy, Anderson)**

   - “The whole is more than the sum of its parts.” (Kurt Koffka)
   - Systems holism (Ludwig von Bertalanffy)
   - “More Is Different.” (Philip W. Anderson)  
     Complex systems exhibit novel properties that cannot be deduced solely from their individual components.

4. **Computational Irreducibility (Turing, Wolfram, Chaitin)**  
   Certain processes cannot be predicted without simulating every step of their computation, as shown by the halting problem, algorithmic randomness, and cellular automata research.

5. **Law of Requisite Variety (Ashby, Boisot & McKelvey)**  
   To regulate external complexity, a system’s internal variety must match or exceed that of its environment. Organizations must design both the quantity and structure of their internal complexity to meet environmental demands.
