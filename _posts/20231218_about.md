### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lee Do-Hyeon from South KoreaðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·

I am affiliated with the [Republic of Korea Army](https://www.army.mil.kr/sites/army/index.do), serving as a [Research Officer for National Defense](https://www.rond.or.kr/CmsHome/MainDefault.aspx). I am currently assigned to the [Agency for Defense Development]() (Jun 2022 - May 2025). I received a B.S. degree in Mathematics from [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/) in Feb 2022.

My research delves into the fascinating relationship between the **mind** and **body**, combining mathematics/philosophy, physics/psychology, and informatics/neuroscience. Utilizing the lens of theoretical neuroscience and probabilistic machine learning theory, my goal is to develop a responsible artificial sentient agent, making significant contributions to consciousness science and AI/robotics. Currently, I am immersed in understanding the synergy between theoretical neuroscience and machine learning theory, with the dream of shaping more efficient and responsible human-level AI agents.

Keywords: **Computational Neuroscience**, **Machine Learning**, **Consciousness Science**, **Human-Level AI**
