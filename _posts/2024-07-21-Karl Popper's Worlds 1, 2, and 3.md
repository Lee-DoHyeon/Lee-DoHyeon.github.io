# Karl Popper's Worlds 1, 2, and 3

> "â€¦ But the problem of the body-mind relationship is a serious problem. It includes the problem of human freedom, which in every respect, including politics, is a fundamental problem; and it includes the problem of man's position in the physical world, the physical cosmos..."

Karl Popper reveals his deep interest in the mind-body problem in the second chapter of his book "All Life is Problem Solving."

Popper considered the mind-body problem to be a crucial philosophical issue closely related to human freedom. He explained the world in terms of **the physical world (World 1)**, **the world of conscious processes (World 2)**, and **the world of objective creations of the human mind (World 3)**. These three worlds interact, and particularly, the existence of World 3 is essential in explaining human self-consciousness through its close connection with World 2.

World 3 is a virtual world consisting of scientific theories, mathematical concepts, works of art, literature, laws, and moral values, all products of the human mind. While these do not directly exist in the physical world, they function as if they are real because we can think and discuss them. Popper believed that through World 3, humans can influence the physical world. Abstract concepts like Newton's theory of gravity or Einstein's theory of relativity, though intangible, have led to technological advancements and created tangible changes in the physical world.

Popper's concept of Worlds 1, 2, and 3 is also useful in exploring the implications of artificial intelligence and information technology on human civilization. AI and information technology serve as tools that extend and deepen World 3. AI analyzes vast amounts of data, discovers new patterns, and generates creative ideas, showing its role beyond being a mere tool and collaborating with humans to enrich World 3's creations.

Moreover, AI with consciousness or feelings can perform functions similar to human conscious processes (World 2). Such AI learns from interactions with humans, exhibits emotional responses, and solves problems creatively. This suggests that AI can develop a form of self-awareness, prompting a reevaluation of human self-consciousness and freedom in a new dimension.

The development of AI and information technology significantly impacts the physical world (World 1). Innovations such as autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and advanced medical technologies lead the way in transforming the physical world. These changes fundamentally restructure human lifestyles and create new interaction modes between humans and AI.

Popper's concept of Worlds 1, 2, and 3 shows that AI and information technology have significant implications for human civilization's advancement. AI shares and expands human uniqueness, creates new innovative products, and traverses physical and conscious processes, playing a vital role in deepening our understanding of existence and civilization.

### Summary

> In his book "All Life is Problem Solving," Karl Popper considered the mind-body problem as a crucial philosophical issue closely related to human freedom. He explained the world by dividing it into three realms: the physical world (World 1), the world of human conscious processes (World 2), and the objective creations of the human mind (World 3). Popper argued that these three worlds interact to form human self-awareness and civilization. Artificial intelligence and information technology expand and deepen World 3, collaborating with humans to generate new knowledge and creative ideas, thereby bringing about tangible changes in the physical world. These technologies share and extend human uniqueness, playing a significant role in deepening our understanding of existence and civilization.
