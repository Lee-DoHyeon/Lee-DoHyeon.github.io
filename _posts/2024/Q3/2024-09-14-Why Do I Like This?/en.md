## Why Do I Study Philosophy, Mathematics, Physics, Cybernetics, Information Science, and Neuroscience?

Is a qualitative difference merely a quantitative one? Where does qualitative analysis originate?

Is information physical, or is physics informational?

Where do the boundaries between mathematical form and physical implementation lie, and how do they arise?

What is a model? Where is the boundary between a model and a phenomenon?

What were the ideals and goals of cyberneticians, and what were the practical constraints and impossibilities they uncovered?

How can humans process large amounts of information and focus only on what is essential in a short period?

How do humans arrive at reasonable conclusions through rational inference based on incomplete information?

From the perspective of information science, what is the future of artificial intelligence and artificial life?

Are we mechanizing the human mind, or humanizing machines?

How will the vast interactions among matter, objects, humanity, animals, societies, and their components evolve?

Should the objects around us have life cycles similar to living beings?

Should we transition from immortal objects to mortal ones?

## Why Do I Explore the Epistemological Limits of Humans and Analyze Their Implications?

Scale, perspective, observation, perception, interaction, selfhood, language, society.

An inquiry into the epistemological limits of human understanding.

Experiences that go beyond the imaginable and the boundaries of space and time.

Where are the limits of human perception?

How are the relationships among the mind, body, and behavior structured?

What is the essence of the self and consciousness?

What are the principles of emotion and affective phenomena, and where do they originate?

What are the mechanisms of hypnosis, hallucinations, and illusions, and how do they influence our lives?

Where do free will and freedom stem from?

Where is the boundary between reality and dreams/imagination, and between the real and the virtual?

What distinguishes the soul in a machine from that in a living organism, and how do their ecological roles differ?

In a world of artificial intelligence and artificial life, how will the status of natural intelligence and natural life change?

Systems, organisms, and the countless flows of information and interactions they generate.

Analyzing and understanding the raindrops that fall on oneself in a storm demonstrates the inherent limits of information collection.

Where is my weapon, and where should I search for it?

Through this writing, I hope to engage with others who share these questions and foster a dialogue that extends our collective reflection.
