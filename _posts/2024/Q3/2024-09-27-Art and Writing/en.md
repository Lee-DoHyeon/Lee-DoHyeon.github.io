## Can Art and Writing Coexist with a Career as a Scientist?

### Background

I dream of becoming a scientist. Currently, I’m fulfilling my mandatory military service in South Korea after earning my bachelor’s degree. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of human-level artificial intelligence by pursuing research in fields like information engineering or cybernetics.

Before committing fully to this scientific path, I’ve been pondering whether I could explore artistic and writing endeavors—two activities I’ve always wanted to try. At the same time, I can’t help but wonder: would these pursuits harm my career prospects? To me, they’re not just hobbies; they represent ways to share my passion and vision with others, helping them connect with and understand my ideas.

To gain clarity, I had a thought-provoking conversation with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. I wanted to know how art and writing might complement my scientific ambitions and whether they could become integral parts of my journey as a researcher.
