This post reflects on my current situation after reading [Professor Gershman's Advice for Young Investigators](https://lee-dohyeon.github.io/motivation/Advices-for-young-investigator-en/).

Recently, my health has significantly deteriorated, leading me to explore options such as pursuing a master’s degree or an internship in Korea instead of a PhD abroad. Prioritizing recovery, I’ve resolved not to be overly concerned about taking more time. However, this decision comes with its challenges. It defies the fast-paced “ppalli-ppalli” (*hurry-up*) mindset prevalent in Korean society and means I’ll take longer than directly pursuing a PhD. Additionally, living on the modest stipend of Korean graduate programs is a daunting prospect. Many of my peers have already been in the workforce for years, and I often wonder how grueling this late start in graduate school will be.

Nonetheless, there are valid reasons for this path. Due to a university policy that deferred departmental specialization until after three semesters, coupled with the disruptive onset of COVID-19, half of my college years were marked by **uncertainty**, while the other half felt like **isolation**. This left me in the worst possible environment to secure the critical **(1) recommendations** and **(2) achievements** needed to demonstrate my passion and focus for a PhD. Viewing this as an opportunity rather than an excuse, I believe pursuing a domestic master’s degree or internship could help me build a strong foundation for both. Furthermore, it provides time to apply for beneficial **(3) scholarships**, which could alleviate financial stress. Planning this phase carefully will also allow me to strategize for my entire academic and professional journey, including the eventual pursuit of a PhD. With the right direction, speed becomes secondary. I must meticulously prepare for uncertainties and remain committed to thoughtful planning. Using *Professor Gershman’s advice*, I will select impactful projects and focus my efforts to shape a meaningful future.

One of the main reasons I struggled to produce results at my research institute stems from ***stubbornness***. Since childhood, I’ve been captivated by human consciousness—its interplay with the unconscious, language, and human society. To study these scientifically, I delved into physics, biology, and computer science, eventually majoring in mathematics as the universal language of science. I also collaborated with peers across disciplines to operate academic societies, studying philosophy and cognitive science. At my institute, I encountered cutting-edge AI and robotics technologies, gaining significant insights into the engineering world. However, my aspirations were overwhelming. Consciousness remains a profound mystery, and AI technology often seems directionless, wandering across various fields. My dream of creating “conscious AI” to understand human consciousness felt like chasing the sun—a vision too vast, abstract, and idealistic. Like Icarus who fell from the sky, I crashed under the weight of my ambition.

It’s time to rise again and let go of my greed. My journey is not a sprint but a marathon. Science isn’t just a collection of knowledge but a cultural ecosystem shaped by the activities of countless scientists. Beyond theoretical mathematics, I must learn how to *practice science*. To achieve breakthrough research results, I need to identify questions where **alternative hypotheses can be tested through experimental design**. Phenomena like consciousness and human higher cognitive functions remain uniquely unexplained in history, defying existing theories. Furthermore, modern science demands appropriate resource allocation and collaboration. Research is rarely a solitary endeavor; finding partners for this journey is essential.

What is my unique strength? It lies in my **transdisciplinary approach**. I possess a strong mathematical and philosophical background to understand AI algorithms, combined with a deep knowledge of the historical and conceptual underpinnings of cybernetics, which underlie modern engineering. Additionally, I maintain an anthropological interest in human psychology, religion, economics, and society, while staying attuned to contemporary discussions in consciousness studies.

Building on this foundation, my focus is on **“consciousness and machines.”** As Richard Feynman famously said, ***“If we cannot recreate a phenomenon, we do not truly understand it.”*** To clearly comprehend human consciousness as a biological phenomenon, we must attempt to recreate it. However, creating a conscious agent doesn’t automatically mean we understand consciousness. As Thomas Nagel stated in his seminal 1974 paper, ***“We cannot fully understand a consciousness other than our own.”*** Thus, our starting point is the **implementation of machines that mirror human-like mechanisms of consciousness**.

How should we approach machines with human-like consciousness? Opinions vary. Geoffrey Hinton ([**2022**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.13345)) argues that modern **“digital brains”** are inherently superior to **“analog brains”** due to their support for (1) parallel processing and (2) backpropagation learning algorithms. Opposing views suggest exploring energy-efficient *analog architectures* with superior algorithms ([**Ferenc Huszár, 2023**](https://www.inference.vc/mortal-computation-hintons/), [**Alexander Ororbia, 2024**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09589)). While digital brain superiority has a practical edge due to existing technology, analog brain superiority faces technical hurdles requiring significant time and innovation.

For my PhD, a pragmatic path is to maintain interest in **analog brain superiority** while working within the framework of **digital brain superiority**. Hence, my starting point—**“implementing human-like consciousness mechanisms in machines”**—aligns with developing **software** that embodies these mechanisms. Drawing on theoretical foundations in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, my immediate challenge lies in creating AI systems with consciousness-based higher cognitive functions. What theories and arguments exist regarding human consciousness?

Theoretical approaches in cognitive neuroscience and psychology are highly diverse ([**Anil Seth & Tim Bayne, 2022**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00587-4)). From the **Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT)** to the **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**, affect-based theories, and **Higher-Order Thought (HOT) theories**, these models attempt to explain the processes and functions of consciousness. However, neuroscience lacks experimental results that conclusively validate these models ([**Cogitate Consortium, 2023**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.23.546249v1.full)). This is where theoretical neuroscience, including the **Free Energy Principle** and **Active Inference**, provides a compelling framework. By formalizing these theories through probabilistic and information-theoretic models, we could bridge gaps between cognitive science and machine learning perspectives, such as **probabilistic graphical models (PGMs)** and **variational inference** in **world models**. A well-founded theory, after all, is worth a million experiments.

While some claim world models in AI are already conscious ([**Schmidhuber, 2016**](https://lee-dohyeon.github.io/motivation/Schmidhuber-and-Conscious-Machine-en/)), debates persist about whether they exhibit human-level consciousness. As modern consciousness science interprets consciousness as subjective experience, we need a comprehensive framework to analyze an AI model’s internal representations (mind), interactions (behavior), and operational principles (brain). Beyond fragmented methods like introspective reporting, behavioral experiments, and neuroimaging, AI can enable holistic system-level analysis of cognitive theories. Could this herald the birth of a **new cybernetics movement**?
