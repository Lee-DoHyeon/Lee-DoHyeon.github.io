The human brain consists of approximately 86 billion neurons, which make up only 2% of the body’s weight but consume about 20% of its basal metabolic energy. This energy consumption is around 12W—roughly equivalent to the power usage of a single LED light bulb. Understanding how this energy is utilized for neuronal firing and information processing can be further explained through physical principles such as **[Landauer's Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle)**.

**Landauer's Principle** is a thermodynamic theory that explains the relationship between information processing and energy consumption. The minimum energy required to delete or modify a single bit is defined as:

$$
E \geq k_B T \ln(2)
$$

Here, $k_B$ is the **Boltzmann constant**, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. At the human body temperature (approximately 310K), modifying a single bit requires about $2.97 \times 10^{-21} \, \mathrm{J}$ of energy. Applying this calculation to the brain's total energy consumption (12J per second), the brain is estimated to process about $4.04 \times 10^{21} \, \mathrm{bits/s}$. On a per-neuron basis, this translates to a bit modification rate of approximately $4.7 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{bits/s}$.

However, the firing rate of neurons is limited by physiological constraints, with a refractory period restricting the maximum firing rate to around 1,000 times per second. This reflects the physical limits of neuronal activity, but firing is only one part of the information processing mechanism. Neurons also integrate information through parallel connections, performing complex computations at the network level. Thus, the Landauer-based calculation of $4.7 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{bits/s}$ per neuron far exceeds the firing rate, highlighting the brain's capacity for parallel information processing.

In comparison, modern CPUs operate at up to 5.85GHz, executing approximately 5.85 billion state transitions per second. This is about 5.8 million times faster than the firing rate of a neuron. However, while computers excel in high-speed serial processing, the brain demonstrates unparalleled advantages in parallel processing. This fundamental difference defines the distinct approaches of these two systems to information processing.

In conclusion, the human brain has evolved to prioritize **energy efficiency and parallel processing capabilities** over sheer speed. The minimum energy threshold described by **Landauer's Principle** provides critical insights not only for computer design but also for applications like brain-computer interfaces. The disparity between neuronal firing rates and Landauer's calculations underscores the importance of network-level complexity in brain function. Ultimately, the brain represents a highly efficient and adaptive system, refined through evolution to achieve optimal functionality.
