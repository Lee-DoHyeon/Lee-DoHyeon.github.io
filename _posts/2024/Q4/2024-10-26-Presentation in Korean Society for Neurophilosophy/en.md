Earlier this year, through connections made at the “[**Korean Academy of Consciousness Studies X Korean Society for Neurophilosophy Symposium**](https://lee-dohyeon.github.io/movement/KACS-x-KSCN-Meeting-en/),” I was invited to give an external lecture at the **Korean Society for Neurophilosophy**, supported by the [**YouMe Science and Culture Foundation**](http://www.youmeacademy.org/index.html). Preparing to speak in front of professors with PhDs in various fields, I wanted to select a topic that would not only leverage my background but also offer something unique and engaging.

The topic I chose was **"The Mind, Behavior, and Brain of Humans and Machines"**, and because of the volume of material, I divided it across two sessions held on September 6 and October 4. Here is a brief overview of the main points covered:

1. **The Mind, Behavior, and Brain of Humans**  
   What is the relationship between the mind, behavior, and the brain? What is the nature of consciousness? How do processes like perception, learning, emotion regulation, and attention function? These questions lead us to explore scientific approaches that aim to integrate our understanding of the human mind and brain, focusing particularly on the ‘Active Inference’ and ‘Free Energy Principle’ concepts, which are widely recognized in computational and theoretical neuroscience.

2. **The Mind, Behavior, and Brain of Machines**  
   Could machines ever achieve human-level intelligence or experience emotions? How might we design machines to be as efficient as the human brain? In this section, I explored the theoretical frameworks and technological methods that might enable intelligent machines to emulate human cognitive functions. The discussion included the philosophy and science of machine consciousness, efforts to develop human-level AI, and neuromorphic computing devices inspired by the human brain.

3. **Coexistence of Humans and Machines**  
   What impact might machines with human-level intelligence have on society? Could conscious machines be granted legal rights or responsibilities? Here, I addressed the possibility of highly intelligent machines and the potential social ripple effects of their emergence, raising questions about the societal agreements needed for humans and machines to coexist harmoniously.

To thoroughly consider the impact of technological advances on humanity, I believed it essential to ground the discussion in the historical context of the cybernetics movement and revolutionary developments in cognitive science and philosophy of mind that followed World War II. Today, the emergence of artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, algorithm-based platforms, and similar technologies gives us cause to re-examine the relationship between humanity and technology. Here’s why I prepared this presentation:

> “Today, we live in a time where the study of the mind, behavior, and brain of humans and machines is more relevant than ever. The rapid advancement of AI and neuroscience is reshaping our daily lives and society, impacting not just technology but the very nature of our existence, social structures, and ethical values.”

> “This presentation aims to highlight how advancements in science and technology go beyond mere convenience, with the potential to redefine human nature and fundamentally alter our future. In particular, by exploring how the minds and brains of humans and machines can connect, interact, and evolve, I hope to lay a foundation for designing a better future.”

> “Right now, AI technology is already having practical impacts across numerous fields, with innovations like lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs), deepfake crimes, and BCI technology posing significant risks alongside their promising potential. These changes are no longer hypothetical scenarios but realities our society faces today. We must develop a profound understanding of these shifts and establish ethical standards to guide them.”

> “You, as scientists, philosophers, and humanities scholars gathered here, stand at the center of these transformative times. You are among the first to recognize the challenges and opportunities these advancements bring, and it is your responsibility to seek proactive solutions. By re-examining the relationship between humans and machines and sharing the knowledge and insights needed to prepare for the future, I hope we can take the first step toward a more promising direction.”

After the lecture, a professor referred to me as "Korean von Neumann." Inspired by this, I’m more determined than ever to become a successful interdisciplinary researcher.
