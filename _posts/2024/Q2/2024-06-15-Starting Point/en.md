## ðŸ’¡ Research Introduction


My research aims to discover a unified formal framework that explains, predicts, and controls various mental phenomena to form a scientific understanding of the human and animal mind, brain, and behavior. In the process, it seeks new understandings of previously unexplained phenomena and contributes to implementing theoretically responsible human-level intelligent machines. To achieve this, I combine (1) historical knowledge of the cybernetics movement, philosophy of mind, and neurophilosophy, (2) mathematical data analysis based on probability theory and graph theory, (3) physical modeling using statistical mechanics and complexity physics, and (4) engineering applications using artificial intelligence and robotics.

## ðŸ’¡ **Research Topics**


I have identified several research topics that I aim to tackle throughout my life. I seek to understand and integrate the relationships between various principles proposed to explain the mind-brain-behavior, thereby unifying the differentiated dynamics and integrating the mechanics. To verify effectiveness, I propose a unified theory of phenomena that modern science has yet to explain or has only recently begun to explain. Moreover, I design safe and advanced machines at the human/animal level by applying key theories observed in humans and animals, contributing to society.

(1) Integrated Theoretical System of Mind-Body-Behavior: I analyze the relationships between numerous existing principlesâ€”such as the Free Energy Principle, Inductive Bias Principle, Approximation Principle, Data Compression Principle, Resource Limitation Principle, and Evolutionary Principleâ€”and provide an integrated theoretical system of mind-body-behavior.

(1-1) Consciousness Phenomenon: I formally compare theories of consciousness such as Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory, Predictive Coding Theory, Attention Schema Theory, and Affective-Based Theories to propose a formal theory. I further propose simulation models of the content of consciousness and machine devices that mimic its effects and principles.

(1-2) Hypnosis Phenomenon: I advance existing predictive coding theory and drug-based experiments, proposing a comprehensive formal theory on the effects and principles of human language. Additionally, I theoretically propose machine devices that simulate not only the content of consciousness but also its effects and principles.

(2) Theory-Based Algorithms and Machine Design: I propose human-level AI models and bio-inspired machines that are explainable and consider biological complexity, based on theories from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science.

(2-1) Optimization with Limited Resources: Based on theories explaining how humans and animals effectively focus attention and make decisions with limited resources (time, energy, etc.), I propose not only efficient AI models but also the theoretical background for efficient machine devices.

(2-2) Crossing the Boundaries of Symbols: Based on theories explaining how symbolic systems like mathematics and language can emerge from sub-symbolic neural networks, I propose efficient language models. Moreover, I suggest a new methodology for verifying and analyzing trained sub-symbolic neural networks, proposing a theoretical background for evaluating the stability of AI models.

(2-3) Biological Complexity and Useful Starting Points: Based on theories of how evolutionary psychological factors help perceive the world and survive, I challenge the Tabula Rasa paradigm that ignores biological complexity in learning from a blank slate and propose a theoretical framework for efficient AI models. -->
