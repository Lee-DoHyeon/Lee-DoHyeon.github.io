Professor Seunghwan Kim of the Physics Department at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology) is the inaugural president of the Korean Society for Computational Neuroscience. Professor Kim has made significant contributions in modeling complex brain functions through mathematical and physical theories, and has mentored numerous scholars in the field. Personally, Professor Kim had a profound impact on my decision to pursue studies at POSTECH. In fact, it was after attending his classes that I decided to switch my major to mathematics after my third semester.


This year's Nonlinear and Complex Systems Symposium was especially meaningful because it also served as a retirement celebration for Professor Kim. I was determined to attend, and I was fortunate enough to receive information about the event, allowing me to participate. I consider it a great honor to have been part of this event.


Additionally, the symposium saw the participation of the Korean Society for Econophysics, where I had the pleasure of meeting esteemed professors such as Woo-Sung Jung, Hawoong Jeong, and Jae-Sung Jeong. Engaging with these respected scholars was both inspiring and rewarding, providing me with new academic insights.
