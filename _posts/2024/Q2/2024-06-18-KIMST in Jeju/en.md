## Arrival at Jeju Airport

As soon as we landed at Jeju Airport, we picked up the rental car we had reserved in advance and set off. Since it was a bit of a drive to the conference venue, we decided to grab a meal on the way. We stopped at a nearby restaurant called "Meokdol," known for its local specialties, Gogi Guksu (pork noodle soup) and Yukjeon (pan-fried beef). As expected, the food was delicious, and we all enjoyed it thoroughly.

## Osulloc Tea Museum

Located in the southwest of Jeju, about the 8 o'clock direction on a clock, Osulloc Tea Museum is a popular destination where the famous Korean tea brand Osulloc displays its tea fields and offers a cafe experience. The place was packed with tourists, especially foreigners, with what seemed like tour buses arriving every hour.

Despite the hot weather, many people were enjoying a stroll outside. The tea fields, bathed in the June sunshine, were glowing with the fresh green color of young tea leaves, harmonizing beautifully with the clear blue sky. The view stretched to the horizon, where the sky met the clouds, and the gentle breeze made the moment feel refreshingly peaceful.

## Sa-Gye Beach

Sagye Beach, located on the southern coast of Jeju, is renowned for its rugged cliffs carved by strong winds and erosion. The summer landscape was made even more striking by the moss-covered rocks along the shoreline.

As I walked along the sandy beach, I was mesmerized by the shifting shadows on the sand, created by the wind. The shadows constantly changed depending on the angle and position, offering a unique visual experience.

## Jung-moon Beach
Before the conference began, I visited Jungmun Beach at dawn. Known as a surfing hotspot in Korea, this beach is famous for its strong southern winds that create dynamic waves.

After a short surfing lesson, we headed out to the ocean. With the crashing waves in the background, our surf instructor snapped some great photos, capturing the energy of the sea.

## Conference and Hall Exhibition
After a quick breakfast following our early-morning surfing session, we made our way to the conference venue. The conference was held at Jeju International Convention Center, not far from the beach, and was attended by various researchers and stakeholders from the field.

At the conference, I stumbled upon Nam June Paik’s famous work, "TV Cello." Being a frequent visitor of the Nam June Paik Art Center, it was an emotional moment to see one of his rare works on display here in Jeju.

Right behind the artwork, a small photo exhibition by Polish photographer Marcin Ryczek was being held. His ability to capture fleeting moments with such precision was truly impressive.

## Coffee Omakase
Near the conference venue, we took a break at a place called "Jungmun Villa," which is famous for its Coffee Omakase. They served a variety of coffees using their own blend of beans, with flavors that highlighted the rich and diverse characteristics of the beans.

The surrounding area was vast and neatly arranged, and it turned out that the owner's sister is a renowned contemporary artist in Korea. After discussing some ideas about future plans for the site, we returned to the conference.

## Olle Trail Hike
On the final morning, I took an early hike along the Olle Trail, choosing a route that covered both the Jusangjeolli Cliffs and Jungmun Beach. It turned out to be a fantastic choice, and I thoroughly enjoyed the scenic walk.

<div class="centered-container"> <div class="two-fig-container"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/posts/2024/Q2/2024-06-18-KIMST in Jeju/0614-1-올레길 1.jpg" style="width: 80%; height: auto;"> <figcaption> The magnificent Jusangjeolli Cliffs. </figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/posts/2024/Q2/2024-06-18-KIMST in Jeju/0614-1-올레길 7.jpg" style="width: 80%; height: auto;"> <figcaption> A photo taken as we descended from the hill, capturing the forest and sea perfectly combined. </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div>
We split into two teams, starting from opposite ends of the trail and walking towards each other. Halfway through, we met the other group, creating a fun and memorable moment.

This conference trip gave me the chance to immerse myself in Jeju’s breathtaking natural landscapes and find inner peace. The endless blue sky and sea, the vibrant green tea fields, and the island's unique geological formations all helped me recharge and find balance. Above all, sharing this experience with my juniors and colleagues made the journey even more special. Despite the demanding schedule, every moment was filled with laughter, support, and camaraderie. This trip will remain a cherished memory for years to come. I’m so grateful and happy to have been part of it.
