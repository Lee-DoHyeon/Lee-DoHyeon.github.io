Lately, my mind has been clouded with thoughts about my future. The path I envision is one that no one has truly ventured down, and I often find myself wondering if it would be wiser to pursue a more stable career or a professional certification like many others. Despite my resolve, the isolation of self-study and following my own interests has left me feeling more lonely and fragile.

Even after seeking advice from close seniors and peers, the anxiety lingers, and my mind remains overwhelmed with countless thoughts. Countless worst-case scenarios, which haven't even occurred yet, haunt me and make me feel weakened and vulnerable.

I know I’m not alone in facing these struggles. Everyone is trying to survive in an unstable society, battling to find their identity. I feel deep empathy and sadness, especially for those in their early to mid-20s, who are still grappling with their identity and the fundamental fears of being replaceable.

With these thoughts weighing on me, I decided to organize a small performance at a local lounge. After several contacts with the lounge owner, I was finally able to secure a slot. I was given about 2 hours, during which I prepared three 40-minute mixes. The goal of this performance was to offer a brief escape to those who, like me, are overwhelmed by worries about their future and career. I created mixes titled (1) Overthinking, (2) GroovyTwilight, and (3) LoungeTechno, with the intention of sending a message that life is not just about the relentless pursuit of happiness or the constant comparison with others. Below is the promotional video I made for the event.

The first mix, Overthinking, is composed mainly of works by experimental artists based in Toronto. It features addictive beats contrasting with lyrical melodies, and the lyrics reflect concerns about reality and the desire for freedom. The track that best represents the mood of this playlist is "Thoughts of the Night" by INNR CIRCLE, with its slow tempo and emphasized vocals perfectly capturing the feeling of sleepless nights filled with thoughts. I DJed this mix from 8:00 to 8:40 PM.

The second mix, GroovyTwilight, blends groovy disco and techno seamlessly. It’s characterized by the upbeat energy of disco mixed with the dreamy vibes of techno. The standout track for this playlist is "It Makes You Forget" by the renowned DJ Peggy Gou, conveying a positive message to let go of the anxieties and worries that fill our minds.

Lastly, LoungeTechno was the session I DJed from 9:00 to 10:00 PM, focusing on strong beats and a hypnotic atmosphere fitting for the late evening.

The lounge owner captured some video clips during my performance. The lounge was equipped with a large display screen, where media art was showcased during the performance. Despite the rainy weather, many people visited the lounge, and I am truly grateful for that. This event was a refreshing break from the busy early summer and a deeply fulfilling experience for me.
