On January 6th, 2024, I had the privilege of organizing the second offline meeting of the [Korean Association for Consciousness Sciences (KACS)](https://kacs.me/), where I serve as vice president. We were fortunate to host the symposium at a cozy office space provided by the [Korean Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS)](https://www.kfas.or.kr/) in Gangnam, allowing us to conduct the event successfully.

This offline meeting was particularly special because it garnered significant interest from the Korean Society for NeuroPhilosophy (KSNP). Unlike KACS, which is primarily composed of undergraduate and graduate students, KSNP includes renowned professors in philosophy, psychiatry, and neuroscience, as well as international lawyers and other professionals. It was a rare and valuable opportunity where science and philosophy truly converged.

Professor Park Hyung-Dong, who recently joined the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at KAIST, presented a scientific approach to consciousness based on the interaction between the brain and body. He introduced us to his research related to brain activity connected to heartbeats.

I was also asked to give a presentation. Although unrelated to my work at the research institute, I shared my long-standing interests from my undergraduate studies, the studies I led at KACS, and the results we achieved. My presentation, titled "Can AI Have Consciousness?" explored the possibility of conscious robots and painted a picture of the future. I was thrilled to receive such positive feedback from the attendees.

The presentation by master’s student Na Hyeong-Seok was particularly memorable. Professors in psychiatry and neurosurgery posed critical questions about whether the fields of neuroscience and psychiatry are scientifically structured. It was an excellent opportunity to discuss the historical issues in psychiatry and its future and potential for development.

Working at the research institute sometimes makes me feel distant from my ultimate dreams or experience sudden loneliness. This symposium was a profoundly joyful time and reaffirmed the value of my cherished community. I look forward to continuing and expanding these activities, hoping to achieve our shared goals together.
