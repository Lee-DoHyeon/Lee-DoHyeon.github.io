  Hi, thereðŸ‘‹ I&#39;m Do-Hyeon Lee from South KoreaðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·
</h3>
<p>
  I am affiliated with the
  <a href="https://www.army.mil.kr/sites/army/index.do" style="color: black"
    >Republic of Korea Army</a
  >, serving as a
  <a href="https://www.rond.or.kr/CmsHome/MainDefault.aspx" style="color: black"
    >Research Officer for National Defense</a
  >. I am currently assigned to the
  <a href="https://www.add.re.kr/eps" style="color: black"
    >Agency for Defense Development</a
  >
  (Jun 2022 - May 2025). I received a B.S. degree in Mathematics from
  <a href="https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/" style="color: black">POSTECH</a> in
  Feb 2022.

  My research delves into the fascinating relationship between the
  <strong>mind</strong> and <strong>body</strong>(mind, brain and behavior),
  combining mathematics/philosophy, physics/psychology, and
  informatics/neuroscience. Utilizing the lens of theoretical neuroscience and
  probabilistic machine learning theory, my goal is to develop a responsible
  artificial sentient agent, making significant contributions to consciousness
  science and AI/robotics. Currently, I am immersed in understanding the synergy
  between theoretical neuroscience and machine learning theory, with the dream
  of shaping more efficient and responsible human-level AI agents.
