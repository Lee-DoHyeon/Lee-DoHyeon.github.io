### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Do-Hyeon Lee from South KoreaðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·

I am affiliated with the <span >[Republic of Korea Army](https://www.army.mil.kr/sites/army/index.do)<span>, serving as a <span >[Research Officer for National Defense](https://www.rond.or.kr/CmsHome/MainDefault.aspx)<span>. I am currently assigned to the <span >[Agency for Defense Development](https://www.add.re.kr/eps)<span> (Jun 2022 - May 2025). I received a B.S. degree in Mathematics from <span >[POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/)<span> in Feb 2022.

My research delves into the fascinating relationship between the **mind** and **body**(mind, brain and behavior), combining mathematics/philosophy, physics/psychology, and informatics/neuroscience. Utilizing the lens of theoretical neuroscience and probabilistic machine learning theory, my goal is to develop a responsible artificial sentient agent, making significant contributions to consciousness science and AI/robotics. Currently, I am immersed in understanding the synergy between theoretical neuroscience and machine learning theory, with the dream of shaping more efficient and responsible human-level AI agents.

Keywords: **Computational Neuroscience**, **Machine Learning**, **Consciousness Science**, **Human-Level AI**
