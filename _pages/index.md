### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Do-Hyeon Lee from South KoreaðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·

I am affiliated with the <span >[Republic of Korea Army](https://www.army.mil.kr/sites/army/index.do)<span>, serving as a <span >[Research Officer for National Defense](https://www.rond.or.kr/CmsHome/MainDefault.aspx)<span>. I am currently assigned to the <span >[Agency for Defense Development](https://www.add.re.kr/eps)<span> (Jun 2022 - May 2025). I received a B.S. degree in Mathematics from <span >[POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/)<span> in Feb 2022.

### About Me:

**Exploring:** I am dedicated to exploring a unified framework that connects the mind, body, and behavior. This means understanding how our thoughts, brain functions, and actions are interconnected.

**Interdisciplinary Approach:** My research spans a wide range of fields. I draw from mathematics and philosophy, as well as robotics and hardware design. This interdisciplinary approach helps me look at problems from various angles and find innovative solutions.

**Focus Areas:**

- **Human-Level Intelligent Agents:** I am focused on developing AI that can perform tasks and think at a level similar to humans.
- **Artificial Consciousness and Emotions:** I am researching how to create AI that can experience consciousness and emotions.
- **Societal Applications and Ethical Issues of AI:** I am deeply concerned with how AI can be used responsibly in society and the ethical implications of its use.
- **Philosophy of Technology, Cybernetics, and Artificial Life:** I explore the philosophical questions related to technology, the science of control and communication in animals and machines (cybernetics), and artificial life.

**Current Work:** Currently, I am working on AI and robotics weapon systems. My background in mathematics supports this work, allowing me to develop sophisticated algorithms and models.

**Looking For:** I am seeking a Ph.D. program that aligns with my interests, particularly in:

- **Theory-Driven Reinforcement Learning:** I want to dive deeper into how theoretical frameworks can improve reinforcement learning in AI.
- **Informatics on Consciousness and Emotions:** I am interested in studying how information technology can help us understand and replicate consciousness and emotions in machines.

Keywords: **Computational Neuroscience**, **Human-Level AI**, **Consciousness and Feeling**
