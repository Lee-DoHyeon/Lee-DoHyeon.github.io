    <p><span class="first-word">First,</span> my research focuses on <strong>theoretical algorithm and device design</strong> for human-level intelligent machines. These designs are based on insights from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science, derived from organisms that have successfully survived with limited resources(e.g. time and energy). Primarily, I am interested in proposing <strong>AI models</strong> and <strong>computing devices</strong> based on theoretical breakthroughs such as <strong>Active Inference</strong>. This exploration seeks to uncover the potential for energy-efficient and fast intelligent algorithms. Furthermore, I am deeply interested in how <strong>symbolic systems</strong> such as <strong>language</strong> and <strong>mathematics</strong> emerge from sub-symbolic systems such as neural networks. This includes proposing responsible language models and discovering new methods to evaluate AI model stability(related post). Lastly, I propose AI models inspired by <strong>evolutionary psychology</strong>, challenging the traditional <strong><i>Tabula Rasa</i></strong> paradigm and emphasizing the importance of biological complexity in the learning process.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">Additionally,</span> I am dedicated to developing a <strong>unified framework</strong> for the mind-behavior-brain connection. This involves analyzing principles such as the <strong>free energy principle</strong>, <strong>inductive bias principle</strong>, and <strong>data compression principle</strong>. This approach plays a crucial role in incorporating previously unexplained phenomena into the scientific domain. For example, to investigate <strong>consciousness</strong>, I formalize and compare existing theories like the <strong>global neural workspace theory</strong>, <strong>attention schema theory</strong>, and <strong>predictive coding theory</strong>. Through these comparisons, I propose new theories and plan more extensive research by implementing simulations. Furthermore, to explore <strong>hypnosis</strong>, I analyze existing theories and drug-based experiments. I also connect theories on the effects and principles of language to propose new theories and develop simulation models, thereby enriching the research.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">To achieve these goals</span>, I combine: (1) knowledge from the history of cybernetics and philosophy of mind; (2) mathematical data analysis methods using probabilistic inference and graph theory; (3) modeling with statistical mechanics and complex systems physics; (4) applications of reinforcement learning, world models, and robotics.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">In conclusion,</span> my research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical principles and practical applications, providing a comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena and contributing to the advancement of intelligent machine design.</p>
