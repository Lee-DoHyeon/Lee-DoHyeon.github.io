        <figcaption class="caption" style="color: #888888;">I believe that fostering a dynamic synergy between human and machine intelligence will pave the way for a better world. Envisioning a future where truly understanding the intricate connections between mind, behavior, and brain brings forth highly efficient and responsible AI, this collaboration propels humanity and technology into a shared ascent. It empowers us to authentically deepen our understanding of ourselves and the universe.</figcaption>

    <p><span class="first-word">First,</span> my research focuses on <span class="bold">theoretical algorithm and device design</span> for human-level intelligent machines. These designs are based on insights from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science, derived from organisms that have successfully survived with limited resources such as time and energy. Primarily, I am interested in proposing <span class="bold">AI models</span> and <span class="bold">computing devices</span> that mimic human mechanisms of <span class="bold">attention</span> and <span class="bold">decision-making</span>. This exploration seeks to uncover the potential for energy-efficient and rapid intelligent algorithms. Furthermore, I am deeply interested in how <span class="bold">symbolic systems</span> like <span class="bold">language</span> and <span class="bold">mathematics</span> emerge from sub-symbolic systems such as neural networks. This includes proposing responsible language models and discovering new methods to evaluate AI model stability. Lastly, I propose AI models inspired by <span class="bold">evolutionary psychology</span>, challenging the traditional <span class="bold">Tabula Rasa</span> paradigm and emphasizing the importance of biological complexity in the learning process.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">Additionally,</span> I am dedicated to developing a <span class="bold">unified framework</span> for the mind-behavior-brain connection. This involves analyzing principles such as the <span class="bold">free energy principle</span>, <span class="bold">inductive bias principle</span>, and <span class="bold">data compression principle</span>. This approach plays a crucial role in incorporating previously unexplained phenomena into the scientific domain. For example, to investigate <span class="bold">consciousness</span>, I formalize and compare existing theories like the <span class="bold">global neural workspace theory</span>, <span class="bold">attention schema theory</span>, and <span class="bold">predictive coding theory</span>. Through these comparisons, I propose new theories and plan more extensive research by implementing simulations. Furthermore, to explore <span class="bold">hypnosis</span>, I analyze existing theories and drug-based experiments. I also connect theories on the effects and principles of language to propose new theories and develop simulation models, thereby enriching the research.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">To achieve these goals</span>, I combine: (1) knowledge from the history of cybernetics and philosophy of mind; (2) mathematical data analysis methods using probabilistic inference and graph theory; (3) modeling with statistical mechanics and complex systems physics; (4) applications of reinforcement learning, world models, and robotics.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">In conclusion,</span> my research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical principles and practical applications, providing a comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena and contributing to the advancement of intelligent machine design.</p>
