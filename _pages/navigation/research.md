    <p><span class="first-word">First,</span> my research centers on developing <strong>theoretical algorithms and devices</strong> for human-level intelligent machines. These designs are inspired by insights from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science, particularly focusing on organisms that have successfully adapted to challenging environments with limited resources such as time and energy. Drawing on frameworks like <strong><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5299/Active-InferenceThe-Free-Energy-Principle-in-Mind" target="_blank">Active Inference</a></strong>, I aim to propose <strong>AI models</strong> and <strong>computing devices</strong> that are energy-efficient and computationally robust, with the potential to revolutionize intelligent algorithms. Additionally, I explore the emergence of <strong>symbolic systems</strong>, such as <strong>language</strong> and <strong>mathematics</strong>, from sub-symbolic systems like neural networks, contributing to the development of responsible language models and novel methods for evaluating AI model stability.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">Additionally,</span> I am dedicated to creating a <strong>unified framework</strong> for understanding the intricate relationships between the mind, behavior, and brain. This involves analyzing foundational principles such as the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle" target="_blank">free energy principle</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691205717/what-makes-us-smart" target="_blank">inductive bias</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4360" target="_blank">data compression</a></strong>. Through this approach, I aim to integrate previously unexplained phenomena, such as human consciousness and hypnosis, into the scientific domain. To investigate <strong>consciousness</strong>, I compare and formalize existing theories, including the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory" target="_blank">global neural workspace theory</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_schema_theory" target="_blank">attention schema theory</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding" target="_blank">predictive coding theory</a></strong>, and propose new models validated through simulations. For <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis" target="_blank">hypnosis</a></strong>, I analyze theoretical frameworks, empirical studies, and drug-based experiments, while exploring the cognitive effects of language to develop simulation models and propose novel theories.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">To achieve these objectives,</span> my research incorporates: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Knowledge from the history of cybernetics and philosophy of mind to establish a theoretical foundation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Mathematical and computational tools, such as probabilistic inference, graph theory, and statistical mechanics, to model complex systems.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Applications of reinforcement learning, world models, and robotics to bridge theory and practice in intelligent machine design.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">In conclusion,</span> my work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical principles and practical applications, advancing the development of intelligent systems capable of human-level cognition and behavior. By addressing unresolved phenomena and proposing innovative solutions, I seek to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mind, behavior, and brain, while fostering progress in AI and cognitive science.</p>
