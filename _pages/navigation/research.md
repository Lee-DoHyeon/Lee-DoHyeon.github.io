    <p><span class="first-word">First,</span> my research focuses on <strong>theoretical algorithm and device design</strong> for human-level intelligent machines. These designs are based on insights from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science, derived from organisms that have successfully survived with limited resources(e.g. time and energy). Primarily, I am interested in proposing <strong>AI models</strong> and <strong>computing devices</strong> based on theoretical breakthroughs such as <strong><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5299/Active-InferenceThe-Free-Energy-Principle-in-Mind">Active Inference</a></strong>. This exploration seeks to uncover the potential for energy-efficient and fast intelligent algorithms. Furthermore, I am deeply interested in how <strong>symbolic systems</strong> such as <strong>language</strong> and <strong>mathematics</strong> emerge from sub-symbolic systems such as neural networks. This includes proposing responsible language models and discovering new methods to evaluate AI model stability(related post). Lastly, I propose AI models inspired by <strong>evolutionary psychology</strong>, challenging the traditional <strong><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa">Tabula Rasa</a></i></strong> paradigm and emphasizing the importance of biological complexity in the learning process.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">Additionally,</span> I am dedicated to developing a <strong>unified framework</strong> for the mind-behavior-brain connection. This involves analyzing principles such as the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle">free energy principle</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691205717/what-makes-us-smart?srsltid=AfmBOop_dR8sjqy7RvLzi3NKNuagv9BGWPHC1dT9s0TR4ZZ42bmF9yVU">inductive bias principle</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4360">data compression principle</a></strong>. This approach plays a crucial role in incorporating previously unexplained phenomena into the scientific domain. For example, to investigate <strong>consciousness</strong>, I formalize and compare existing theories like the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory">global neural workspace theory</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_schema_theory">attention schema theory</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding">predictive coding theory</a></strong>. Through these comparisons, I propose new theories and plan more extensive research by implementing simulations. Furthermore, to explore <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis">hypnosis</a></strong>, I analyze existing theories and drug-based experiments. I also connect theories on the effects and principles of language to propose new theories and develop simulation models, thereby enriching the research.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">To achieve these goals</span>, I combine: (1) knowledge from the history of cybernetics and philosophy of mind; (2) mathematical data analysis methods using probabilistic inference and graph theory; (3) modeling with statistical mechanics and complex systems physics; (4) applications of reinforcement learning, world models, and robotics.</p>
    <p><span class="first-word">In conclusion,</span> my research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical principles and practical applications, providing a comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena and contributing to the advancement of intelligent machine design.</p>
