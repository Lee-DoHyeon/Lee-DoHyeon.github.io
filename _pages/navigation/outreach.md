### Organizational Leadership

  <div style="flex: 7; padding-right: 10px;">
    <p>
      As the 34th Undergraduate President and the 35th Head of Planning at POSTECH Mathematics Student Council, I demonstrated strong organizational leadership. I effectively managed remote interactions and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jYPhNrWqCqZ4FAHdCycUK69WGGhWHxwn/view?usp=sharing"><strong>Student Mentoring Programs</strong></a> during the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring continuous support and engagement. Additionally, I successfully administered the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vf1Um33n0Rn3QW1echOy4iS7DZs5SqMg/view?usp=sharing"><strong>Conversation with Global Senior Alumni program</strong></a>, fostering valuable connections and insights. In recognition of these efforts, I was honored to receive the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vKYyobPUat6Gw6geiqLJghQQKvx9pU_4/view?usp=sharing"><strong>Volunteering Award</strong></a> from the department.

    <p>
      I have been actively involved in leading and organizing various organizations, demonstrating my dedication to fostering vibrant and thriving communities. In 2021, as the 1st Undergraduate President, I helped establish the first <a href="https://minds.postech.ac.kr/postechstudentchapter/"><strong>SIAM Student Chapter</strong></a> in Korea and contributed to the successful organization of the POSTECH-Peking University joint SIAM student chapter conference.

      Currently serving as the Vice-President of the Korean Association for Consciousness Sciences since 2022, I established and operate the '<a href="https://leadohyeon.notion.site/6526475120dd4f4583fb55fb7b5e71ef?pvs=4"><strong>'Brain-Mind-Behavior'</strong></a>' program, organizing a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBan6Afp0tlTxmfm83MkMnW1vOt1k3Ic2&si=nxtGxp3m5ZXzfkKn"><strong>theory study club</strong></a> and a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBan6Afp0tlTPZ_bE8VyHzyCy4EVRFv4b&si=Azf6sgAu3-oAnZKS"><strong>media club</strong></a>. These roles highlight my dedication to enriching these organizations. Recently, I also collaborated with the Korean Society for Neurophilosophy to host seminars with professors in philosophy, neurology, and psychiatry.

      In 2020, I participated in the Think Together Idea Contest organized by the Republic of Korea Army, where I analyzed the impact of intelligent systems on future battlefields. Specifically, I examined the use of drones during the Armenia-Azerbaijan war and proposed a design for an intelligent surveillance system integrating IoT and drones. For this contribution, I was honored with the Army Chief of Staff Award(<a href="https://bemil.chosun.com/nbrd/bbs/view.html?b_bbs_id=10002&pn=1&num=14050#:~:text=%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EA%B3%B5%EB%8C%80%20%EC%88%98%ED%95%99%EA%B3%BC%203%ED%95%99%EB%85%84%20%EC%9D%B4%EB%8F%84%ED%98%84%20%ED%95%99%EC%83%9D%EC%9D%98%20%E2%80%98%EC%A7%80%EB%8A%A5%ED%98%95%20%EC%82%AC%EB%AC%BC%EC%9D%B8%ED%84%B0%EB%84%B7%EA%B3%BC%20%EB%93%9C%EB%A1%A0%EC%9D%84%20%EC%9D%B4%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%9C%20%EC%8A%A4%EB%A7%88%ED%8A%B8%20%EA%B0%90%EC%8B%9C%EC%B2%B4%EA%B3%84%E2%80%99"><strong>article</strong></a>).

      In 2021, I participated in the Militech Challenge under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://npnp.kaist.ac.kr/"><strong>Jung-Ik Lee</strong></a> from KAIST, where I analyzed the potential and specifications of railgun weapon system. This experience heightened my awareness of the threat posed by North Korea's long-range artillery and allowed me to deepen my understanding of international security. I also studied innovative and efficient technologies like Israel's Iron Dome. For my contributions to developing a small railgun system, I was honored with the KAIST President's Award(<a href="https://m.edaily.co.kr/News/Read?newsId=02522326626003112&mediaCodeNo=257"><strong>article</strong></a>).

      In 2021, I participated in the Korea SW Convergence Hackathon to address the health issues of isolated disabled individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over a span of 24 hours, I developed software utilizing artificial intelligence to provide precise posture correction at home. This experience highlighted the crucial role of advanced technology in aiding socially marginalized groups. For this contribution, I was honored with the Daejeon Mayor's Award(<a href="https://www.kbmaeil.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=912862"><strong>article</strong></a>).

I've authored magazine articles focusing on Mathematics topics crafted for young students. These pieces cover diverse subjects like '**[Nonlinear Dynamics and a Weak Critique of the Laplace’s Demon](https://issuu.com/postech-admission/docs/2019_postechian_winter-_17mb_/78)**', '**[Mathematical Analysis of COVID-19](https://issuu.com/postech-admission/docs/2020_postechian_spring__17mb_/78)**', '**[Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem](https://issuu.com/postech-admission/docs/2020_postechian_summer__22mb_/76)**, and '**[Recipes to Generate Random Numbers](https://issuu.com/postech-admission/docs/2020_postechian_autumn__21mb_.pdf/80)**'.

I also wrote an article titled "**[4 Years of University Exploration Record](https://issuu.com/postech-admission/docs/2021_postechian_winter_29/42)**" where I provided advice to undergraduates about navigating university life, drawing from my own experiences as a recent graduate.

      Furthermore, I contributed to the translation of Mark Solms’ book, '<a href="https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000213487062"><strong>The Hidden Spring</strong></a>,’ into Korean, which was published by Ha-Na Medical Publishment Center in June 2024. Through this project, I delved deeply into the theory of consciousness based on active inference. This allowed me to experience the satisfaction of thoroughly understanding a professional text and conveying it to others. I performed this work without any financial compensation and received positive feedback from the public.
