### Organizational Leadership

---

I have played an instrumental role in leading and organizing various organizations, demonstrating my commitment to cultivating vibrant and thriving communities. In 2021, as the 1st Undergraduate President, I spearheaded the establishment of the first **[SIAM Student Chapter](https://minds.postech.ac.kr/postechstudentchapter/)** in the Republic of Korea and contributed the successful organization of the POSTECH-Peking University joint SIAM student chapter conference.

Currently serving as the Vice-President of the Korean Association for Consciousness Sciences since 2022, I have taken the initiative to establish and operate the **['Brain-Mind-Behavior' program](https://leadohyeon.notion.site/6526475120dd4f4583fb55fb7b5e71ef?pvs=4)**. In this capacity, I am actively involved in organizing and overseeing programs, including a **[theory study club](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBan6Afp0tlTxmfm83MkMnW1vOt1k3Ic2&si=nxtGxp3m5ZXzfkKn)** and a **[media club](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBan6Afp0tlTPZ_bE8VyHzyCy4EVRFv4b&si=Azf6sgAu3-oAnZKS)**. These leadership roles showcase my dedication to not only operating but also enriching and invigorating these organizations.

### Academic Service

As a Content Creator, I played a vital role in crafting educational materials for '**[Mathematics for AI](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfWS6_PaCSutSAC7Vu8VHS2uc594cQigv&si=PUY67hIfze3kvEeO)**' in 2021 and '**[Philosophy of AI](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfWS6_PaCSusXxpOxUSs6ONTln3pHWALy&si=xhr-Y8JY3Y6_xmuw)**' in 2022 at the Innovation Center for Education. Additionally, I actively mentored students in Calculus I, Linear Algebra, and its Application throughout Mar 2020 - Jun 2020, Sep 2020 - Dec 2020, and Mar 2021 - Jun 2021. My commitment extended to organizational tasks, where I took a lead in coordinating the **[POSTECH-Peking University Joint SIAM Student Chapter Conference](https://minds.postech.ac.kr/conference-workshop/postech-peking-joint-siam-student-chapter-conference-2021/)**(Apr 2021) and organizing the **[POSTECH SIAM Student Chapter Summer School on 'Anomaly Detection: Random Cut Forest'](https://minds.postech.ac.kr/postechstudentchapter/summerschool2021/)**(Jul 2021).

### Writing and Translation

I've authored magazine articles focusing on Mathematics topics crafted for young students. These pieces cover diverse subjects like '**[Nonlinear Dynamics and a Weak Critique of the Laplace’s Demon](https://issuu.com/postech-admission/docs/2019_postechian_winter-_17mb_/78)**', '**[Mathematical Analysis of COVID-19](https://issuu.com/postech-admission/docs/2020_postechian_spring__17mb_/78)**', '**[Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem](https://issuu.com/postech-admission/docs/2020_postechian_summer__22mb_/76)**, and '**[Recipes to Generate Random Numbers](https://issuu.com/postech-admission/docs/2020_postechian_autumn__21mb_.pdf/80)**'. Furthermore, I played a part in translating Mark Solms' book, **['The Hidden Spring,' into Korean](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000213487062)**, and the project resulted in its publication by Ha-Na Medical Publishment Center in 2024.
