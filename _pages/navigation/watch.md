      <p style="font-size:15px;">In 2021, I was again selected for the Creator Program by the Center for Educational Innovation at POSTECH. In 2022, I developed and conducted the "Philosophy for AI" course for university members and the public. This course explores philosophical and ethical issues related to AI, including philosophy of mind, mathematical logic, lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs), and post-humanism. The course consists of 8 videos, each approximately 30 minutes long, and includes specific assignments and reference materials. Click on the image for more details.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px;">In November 2022, I conducted a seminar for the Young Honor Engineer Society funded by National Academy of Engineering of Korea. The seminar, lasting about 2 hours, introduced the mathematics and related philosophy underpinning AI. The goal was to help engineering students gain a formal understanding of AI technologies and to introduce them to the related philosophical and ethical issues, encouraging socially responsible AI development.

      <p style="font-size:15px;">As Vice President of the Korean Association for Consciousness Sciences (KACS) and leader of the "Mind-Behavior-Brain" initiative, I led a study group focused on Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle and Active Inference. These concepts are highly regarded in computational and theoretical neuroscience. The study group aimed to clearly understand the relationship between the brain, mind, and behavior. Members came from diverse backgrounds, including neuroscience, physics, mathematics, computer science, philosophy, psychiatry, neurology, and psychology. The group met from November 2023 to June 2024, producing 22 videos of approximately 1 hour each, including 2 guest lectures by Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=brhWmCwAAAAJ&hl=en"><strong>Chang-Sub Kim</strong></a>.

      <p style="font-size:15px;">As Vice President of KACS and leader of the "Mind-Behavior-Brain" initiative, I ran a media club that used books, films, podcasts, and public lectures to explore the nature and impact of consciousness and AI. The club encouraged active questioning and discussion about these topics, aiming to understand the significance of consciousness research and its broader societal impacts. The club operated from November 2023 to early 2024 and produced 3 videos, each about 1.5 hours long. Click on the image for more details.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px;">In January 2024, I organized and conducted a joint seminar between KACS and the Korean Society for Neurophilosophy. As a student representative, I gave a 1-hour presentation on AI, robots, and consciousness, analyzing the current state and historical development of AI technology. The seminar introduced discussions on AI and robot consciousness from the perspectives of cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy. It was a valuable opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions about future research directions and societal implications with professors from various fields, including psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience, and philosophy.

      <p style="font-size:15px;">In September and October 2024, With the support of the <a href="http://www.youmeacademy.org/index.html">YouMe Foundation for Science and Culture</a>, I recently delivered two separate lectures for the Korean Society for Neurophilosophy titled "The Mind, Behavior, and Brain of Humans and Machines." The talk explored the historical relationship between philosophy and science in understanding humans and machines, introducing Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle as integrative frameworks. The event gathered leading Korean experts in philosophy, ethics, cognitive science, psychiatry, and neurology to discuss the future of AI and technology. A philosophy professorâ€™s comment calling me "<i>the von Neumann of Korea</i>" was an unforgettable honor.

      <p style="font-size:15px;">In September 2024, I collaborated with the science communication YouTube channel "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@%EC%82%AC%EB%AC%BC%EA%B6%81%EC%9D%B4">Samulgoongi: Miscellaneous Knowledge,</a>" which has 1.56 million subscribers, to produce content on the topic "Can AI Have Consciousness?". The goal of the content was to address various public misconceptions about AI and to spark interest and curiosity about consciousness. This content was selected for the "Science in Everyday Life" series by the <a href="https://www.msit.go.kr/index.do">Korean Ministry of Science and ICT</a> and the <a href="https://www.kosac.re.kr/main">Korean Foundation for Science and Creativity</a>, receiving support from the Science and Technology Promotion Fund and the Lottery Fund. Through this opportunity, I was able to contribute to the development of science and technology in Korea, as well as to the welfare of low-income and marginalized groups.
