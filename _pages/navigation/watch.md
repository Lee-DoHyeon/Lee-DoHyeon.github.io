        <p style="font-size:12px;">In 2020, I was selected for the Creator Program by the Center for Educational Innovation at POSTECH. In 2021, I developed and conducted the "Mathematics for AI" course for both university members and the public. This course aimed to demystify the mathematical foundations of AI, covering topics such as linear algebra, vector calculus, probability, and statistics. The course consists of 18 videos, each approximately 30 minutes long, and includes specific assignments and reference materials to facilitate understanding. Click on the image for more details.</p>

        <p style="font-size:12px;">In 2021, I was again selected for the Creator Program by the Center for Educational Innovation at POSTECH. In 2022, I developed and conducted the "Philosophy for AI" course for university members and the public. This course explores philosophical and ethical issues related to AI, including philosophy of mind, mathematical logic, lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs), and posthumanism. The course consists of 8 videos, each approximately 30 minutes long, and includes specific assignments and reference materials. Click on the image for more details.</p>

        <p style="font-size:12px;">In November 2022, I conducted a seminar for the Young Honor Engineer Society funded by National Academy of Engineering of Korea. The seminar, lasting about 2 hours, introduced the mathematics and related philosophy underpinning AI. The goal was to help engineering students gain a formal understanding of AI technologies and to introduce them to the related philosophical and ethical issues, encouraging socially responsible AI development.

        <p style="font-size:12px;">As Vice President of the Korean Association for Consciousness Sciences (KACS) and leader of the "Mind-Behavior-Brain" initiative, I led a study group focused on Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle and Active Inference. These concepts are highly regarded in computational and theoretical neuroscience. The study group aimed to clearly understand the relationship between the brain, mind, and behavior. Members came from diverse backgrounds, including neuroscience, physics, mathematics, computer science, philosophy, psychiatry, neurology, and psychology. The group met from November 2023 to June 2024, producing 22 videos of approximately 1 hour each, including 2 guest lectures by Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=brhWmCwAAAAJ&hl=en"><strong>Chang-Sub Kim</strong></a>.

        <p style="font-size:12px;">As Vice President of KACS and leader of the "Mind-Behavior-Brain" initiative, I ran a media club that used books, films, podcasts, and public lectures to explore the nature and impact of consciousness and AI. The club encouraged active questioning and discussion about these topics, aiming to understand the significance of consciousness research and its broader societal impacts. The club operated from November 2023 to early 2024 and produced 3 videos, each about 1.5 hours long. Click on the image for more details.</p>

        <p style="font-size:12px;">In January 2024, I organized and conducted a joint seminar between KACS and the Korean Society for Neurophilosophy. As a student representative, I gave a 1-hour presentation on AI, robots, and consciousness, analyzing the current state and historical development of AI technology. The seminar introduced discussions on AI and robot consciousness from the perspectives of cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy. It was a valuable opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions about future research directions and societal implications with professors from various fields, including psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience, and philosophy.
