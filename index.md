## Hello!

I am Do-Hyeon Lee, a [Research Officer for National Defense](https://www.rond.or.kr/CmsHome/MainDefault.aspx). I am currently assigned to Defense AI Center, a subsidiary of the [Agency for Defense Development](https://www.add.re.kr/eps) in South Korea(Jun 2022 - May 2025). After earning my B.S. degree in Mathematics from [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/) in February 2022, I have been dedicated to developing cutting-edge intelligent weapon systems, particularly focusing on _anti-submarine_ and _subterranean_ operations. I am currently preparing for graduate school to further deepen and expand my research.

### Research Interests and Goals

My research is rooted in mathematics and philosophy, aiming to understand and integrate the interconnectedness of the mind, brain functions, neurological circuits, and behavior. I am passionate about developing AI systems that can perform tasks and think at a human-level, and formulating theories on artificial consciousness and feeling. This interdisciplinary approach allows me to analyze problems from multiple perspectives and find innovative solutions. I am particularly interested in **theory-driven reinforcement learning**, **world models in complex environments**, and the **informatics of consciousness and feeling**, aiming to deepen our understanding of humanity itself by designing advanced machines.

### Societal Impact and Leadership

Beyond technical development, I am deeply invested in the societal impact and ethical implications of AI technologies. I explore responsible AI use, philosophy of technology, cybernetics, and artificial life, reflecting my commitment to social sciences and humanities. These interests enhance my role as a socially responsible leader, dedicated to the ethical application of technology.

### Artistic Inclinations and Diverse Activities

In addition to my scientific and technological pursuits, I have a strong interest in the arts and various other activities. My artistic inclinations foster creative thinking and help me approach complex problems from new angles. Experiences in music, art, and literature provide valuable inspiration for my research and social activities, showcasing my multifaceted talents and leadership qualities.

I am excited to explore new possibilities at the forefront of technology and to shape the future of AI. Feel free to learn more about my research and interests on my blog, and let's collaborate to pioneer the future of technology together. Thank you!
