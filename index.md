    <div class="section-title">About Me</div>
    <p>I am Do-Hyeon Lee, a <a href="https://www.rond.or.kr/CmsHome/MainDefault.aspx"><strong>Research Officer for National Defense</strong></a>. I am currently assigned to the Defense AI Center, a subsidiary of the <a href="https://www.add.re.kr/eps"><strong>Agency for Defense Development</strong></a> in South Korea (Jun 2022 - May 2025). After earning my B.S. degree in Mathematics from <a href="https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/"><strong>POSTECH</strong></a> in February 2022, I have been dedicated to developing cutting-edge intelligent weapon systems, particularly focusing on <em>anti-submarine</em> and <em>subterranean</em> operations. I am currently preparing for graduate school to further deepen and expand my research.</p>
    
    <div class="section-title">Research Introduction</div>
    <p>My research aims to develop a comprehensive formal framework to understand the mind, brain, and behavior of humans and animals. This framework seeks to explain, predict, and control various mental phenomena. I aim to understand previously unexplained phenomena and contribute to the development of theory-driven human-level intelligent machines. To achieve this, I combine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Knowledge from the history of cybernetics, philosophy of mind, and neurophilosophy</li>
        <li>Mathematical data analysis methods using probabilistic inference and graph theory</li>
        <li>Modeling with statistical mechanics and complex systems physics</li>
        <li>Applications of optimal control theory, reinforcement learning, world models, and robotics</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="section-title">Research Details</div>
    <p>My research covers various topics and analyzes multiple principles to propose an integrated theory. This helps to understand unexplained phenomena and design intelligent machines for humans and animals.</p>
    
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>(1) Integrated Theory of Body-Mind-Behavior</h3>
        <p>Analyzing principles such as the free energy principle, inductive bias principle, and data compression principle to create a unified framework.</p>
        <h4>(1-1) Consciousness Phenomena</h4>
        <p>Formalizing and comparing theories like the global neural workspace theory, attention schema theory, and predictive coding theory to propose new ones, implementing simulation models.</p>
        <h4>(1-2) Hypnosis Phenomena</h4>
        <p>Developing predictive coding theories and substance-based experiments, proposing theories on the effects and principles of languages, and implementing simulation models.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>(2) Theory-Driven Algorithm and Device Design</h3>
        <p>Designing AI models and computing devices based on neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science theories.</p>
        <h4>(2-1) Optimization with Limited Resources</h4>
        <p>Suggesting AI models and computing devices based on theories explaining effective attention and decision-making with limited resources (time, energy).</p>
        <h4>(2-2) Formation of Symbolic Systems</h4>
        <p>Theorizing how symbolic systems emerge from sub-symbolic systems like neural networks. Suggesting responsible language models, while discovering new methods to evaluate AI model stability.</p>
        <h4>(2-3) Biological Complexity and Useful Initial Points</h4>
        <p>Proposing AI models inspired by evolutionary psychology, challenging the <i>Tabula Rasa</i> paradigm by considering biological complexity in learning.</p>
