    <p>Welcome! I am Do-Hyeon Lee from the Republic of KoreaðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·, currently serving as a <a href="https://www.rond.or.kr/CmsHome/MainDefault.aspx"><strong>Research Officer for National Defense</strong></a>. I work at the <a href="https://www.add.re.kr/eps"><strong>Defense AI Center</strong></a>, a subsidiary of the Agency for Defense Development. Since earning my B.S. in Mathematics from <a href="https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/"><strong>POSTECH</strong></a> in February 2022, I have been committed to developing advanced intelligent systems for challenging environments, such as <em>anti-submarine warfare</em> and <em>underground operations</em>. I am now preparing for graduate school to further deepen and expand my research.</p>
    <p>My research stems from a deep curiosity about <i>human nature</i> and the <i>complexities of life</i>. I utilize computational modeling and mathematical formalization to study human <strong>consciousness and higher cognitive functions</strong>. In particular, I draw insights from <strong>world models</strong> and <strong>theories of consciousness</strong>, aspiring to develop <strong>human-level agents</strong>. Through this work, I aim to contribute to a clearer understanding of the intricate relationships between mind, behavior, and computation in both humans and machines. Furthermore, I seek to develop perspectives that illuminate unresolved phenomena such as human <strong>consciousness and hypnosis</strong>. <span style="color: #888888;">For more details, please visit the <a href="https://lee-dohyeon.github.io/research/" style="color: #888888;"><strong>RESEARCH</strong></a> page</span>.</p>
