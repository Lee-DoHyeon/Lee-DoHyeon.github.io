    <p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Do-Hyeon Lee from South KoreaðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·, a <a href="https://www.rond.or.kr/CmsHome/MainDefault.aspx"><strong>Research Officer for National Defense</strong></a>. I am currently assigned to the Defense AI Center, a subsidiary of the <a href="https://www.add.re.kr/eps"><strong>Agency for Defense Development</strong></a>. After earning my B.S. degree in Mathematics from <a href="https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/"><strong>POSTECH</strong></a> in February 2022, I have been dedicated to developing cutting-edge intelligent weapon systems, particularly focusing on <em>anti-submarine</em> and <em>subterranean</em> operations. I am currently preparing for graduate school to further deepen and expand my research.</p>
    My research aims to develop a comprehensive formal framework to understand the <span class="bold">mind</span>, <span class="bold">behavior</span>, and <span class="bold">brain</span> of humans and animals. This framework seeks to explain, predict, and control various mental phenomena. By doing so, I aim to understand previously <span class="bold">unexplained phenomena such as consciousness & hypnosis</span> and contribute to the development of <span class="bold">theory-driven human-level intelligent machines</span>. <span style="color: #888888;">For more information, please refer to the <a href="https://lee-dohyeon.github.io/research/" style="color: #888888;"><strong>RESEARCH</strong></a> page.</span>
